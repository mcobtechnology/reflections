It highlights what has changed.
It prevents eyeballing every line.
It speeds up the checking process.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A con is that you may forget to commit over time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Some ways of working lead to lots of content in single files.
Modular coding leads to multiple smaller files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Remember that git log is from bottom to top, old to new
Get the commit you want, and compare to the one below
